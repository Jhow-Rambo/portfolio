A developer who values ​​learning and growing with people, teams and technologies. In addition to always looking to improve myself as a developer every day.

Currently, I'm finishing the electrical engineering course at [Unioeste](https://www.unioeste.br/portal/) and helping to build a software house Sharpy where I am one of the co-founders.

Previously, I worked as an intern at [PTI](https://www.pti.org.br/), where I developed solutions based on artificial intelligence and web development.
